### What is ‘Digital Engineering’?
Well, pretty much anything really. My main skill is web design, but I also write simple computer programs, create vector graphics, posters, charts, — you name it! If you have something in mind that I may be able to help you with, feel free to <a class="email" href="mailto:josh@@@gennao@@@io">send me an email</a>.

### Why 'Gennao.io'?
Gennao means *'to give birth to'* / *'to create'* in Greek. The reason I chose it, though, is simply that it is short and unique. The .io <abbr title="Top-Level Domain">TLD</abbr> was chosen because of it's popularity amongst programmers, which stems from the fact that 'IO' is a very regularly used abbreviation for Input/Output.

### Hosting
I can provide high-quality web hosting for **£10/month**, and domain name registration for about **£10/year**. Hosting is also available to non-clients, but may incur a small set-up fee.
